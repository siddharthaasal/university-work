# Interacting with the networkÂ¶

After you bring up the test network, you can use the peer CLI to interact with your network. The peer CLI allows you to invoke deployed smart contracts, update channels, or install and deploy new smart contracts from the CLI.

Make sure that you are operating from the test-network directory. If you followed the instructions to install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images, You can find the peer binaries in the bin folder of the fabric-samples repository. Use the following command to add those binaries to your CLI Path:

export PATH=${PWD}/../bin:$PATH

You also need to set the FABRIC_CFG_PATH to point to the core.yaml file in the fabric-samples repository:

export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD/../config/

You can now set the environment variables that allow you to operate the peer CLI as Org1:

# Environment variables for Org1

export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:7051

The CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE and CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH environment variables point to the Org1 crypto material in the organizations folder.

If you used ./network.sh deployCC -ccl go to install and start the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode, you can invoke the InitLedger function of the (Go) chaincode to put an initial list of assets on the ledger (if using TypeScript or JavaScript ./network.sh deployCC -ccl javascript for example, you will invoke the InitLedger function of the respective chaincodes).

Run the following command to initialize the ledger with assets. (Note the CLI does not access the Fabric Gateway peer, so each endorsing peer must be specified.)

peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"InitLedger","Args":[]}'

If successful, you should see output similar to the following example:

-> INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200

You can now query the ledger from your CLI. Run the following command to get the list of assets that were added to your channel ledger:

peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["GetAllAssets"]}'

If successful, you should see the following output:

[
  {"ID": "asset1", "color": "blue", "size": 5, "owner": "Tomoko", "appraisedValue": 300},
  {"ID": "asset2", "color": "red", "size": 5, "owner": "Brad", "appraisedValue": 400},
  {"ID": "asset3", "color": "green", "size": 10, "owner": "Jin Soo", "appraisedValue": 500},
  {"ID": "asset4", "color": "yellow", "size": 10, "owner": "Max", "appraisedValue": 600},
  {"ID": "asset5", "color": "black", "size": 15, "owner": "Adriana", "appraisedValue": 700},
  {"ID": "asset6", "color": "white", "size": 15, "owner": "Michel", "appraisedValue": 800}
]

Chaincodes are invoked when a network member wants to transfer or change an asset on the ledger. Use the following command to change the owner of an asset on the ledger by invoking the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode:

peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"TransferAsset","Args":["asset6","Christopher"]}'

If the command is successful, you should see the following response:

2019-12-04 17:38:21.048 EST [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery -> INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200

Because the endorsement policy for the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode requires the transaction to be signed by Org1 and Org2, the chaincode invoke command needs to target both peer0.org1.example.com and peer0.org2.example.com using the --peerAddresses flag. Because TLS is enabled for the network, the command also needs to reference the TLS certificate for each peer using the --tlsRootCertFiles flag.

After we invoke the chaincode, we can use another query to see how the invoke changed the assets on the blockchain ledger. Since we already queried the Org1 peer, we can take this opportunity to query the chaincode running on the Org2 peer. Set the following environment variables to operate as Org2:

# Environment variables for Org2

export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org2MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:9051

You can now query the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode running on peer0.org2.example.com:

peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","asset6"]}'

The result will show that "asset6" was transferred to Christopher:

{"ID":"asset6","color":"white","size":15,"owner":"Christopher","appraisedValue":800}
